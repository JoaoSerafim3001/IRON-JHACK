# Iron Jhack

This is a remake of the original 1983 ZX Spectrum Jumping Jack, a platform game designed by Albert Ball and designed by Stuart C. Ballin.

In this game, Jhack starts at the bottom of the screen and he has 60 seconds to jump from line to line between the holes in each line to get to the green line at the top of the screen.

Jhack can move left and right to get to the nearest hole above him.
When Jhack jumps up a line he scores 5 points and two new holes appear in random lines moving left and right respectively.
